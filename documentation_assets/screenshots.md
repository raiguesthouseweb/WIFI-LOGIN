# Screenshots for Documentation

Since we can't take actual screenshots of the application running, I'm describing what the screenshots would show for each major feature:

## Login Page
- Login form with fields for mobile number and room number/password
- Hotel logo and welcome message
- Instructions for connecting to WiFi

## Admin Dashboard
- Network statistics with active users count
- Data usage charts (download/upload)
- List of currently connected users
- Quick action buttons (disconnect, block)

## Manage Special Users Page
- Tabbed interface (All Users, Staff, Family, Friends, Blocked)
- User list with mobile numbers and status
- Action buttons (edit, block, delete)
- "Add New User" button and modal form

## User Management Workflows
- Adding a special user (staff, family, friend)
- Blocking a user and their device
- Viewing login history and session details
- Unblocking a previously blocked user

These screenshots would enhance the PDF documentation by providing visual context for the features described in the technical documentation.
